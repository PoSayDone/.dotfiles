# Colors.styles descriptions
For wal_steam, colors.styles is one of the most important files, it stores all the color variables that are used elsewhere in steam, and also controls the colors of the majority of the steam client and the ingame overlay.

## Variables
In the main part of the code, there are a bunch of variables that appear to not be used anywhere in the metro for steam directory. At this point it is unknown if these are being used anywhere, so we aren't going to touch them

## Items
This is the section that the first couple versions of wal_steam will be focusing on changing. It is located after the variables. It contains items and their color values, stored in an rgba format.

In the unnoficial patch for metro for steam, there are some 'extras' that are included. Some of these extras must be installed for some items to be colored. For instance, to have the scrollbars be a different color, you will need to install the 'accent scrollbars' extra.
